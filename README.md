Isometric Grid Generator
==================

Following demo (works only in Safari, Google Chrome, Opera and Firefox) called Isometric Grid Generator,
allows you to generate isometric grid background using two simple sliders (controls cell width and height)
and then download it as png image (done using data:uri protocol, so might not work everywhere).
You can also check the source code yourself and see how it's done.
